package URLify

// URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
// has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
//  length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
// perform this operation in place.)
